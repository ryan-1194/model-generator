# Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The user reported that the preview functionality was working correctly, but the generated files had two main issues:
1. **Migration had extra ")" in up() method** - The migration file ended with `}));` instead of `});`
2. **Generated Model was not the same as preview** - The model file didn't match the preview structure

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the `ModelGeneratorService`, I found the following issues:

### Migration Issues:
1. **Extra parenthesis**: In `modifyMigrationFile` method, line 170 had `})` instead of `};`
2. **Duplicate id column**: The regex pattern wasn't working properly, and the service was including user-defined 'id' columns in addition to Laravel's automatic `$table->id()`

### Model Issues:
1. **Complex string replacements**: The `modifyModelFile` method used multiple fragile `str_replace` operations that didn't match the preview generation logic
2. **Different formatting**: The spacing and structure didn't match the preview exactly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified Generation Logic
**Before**: Both `modifyModelFile` and `modifyMigrationFile` had complex, error-prone logic that differed from their preview counterparts.

**After**: Simplified both methods to use the exact same logic as their preview methods:
```php
// Model generation now uses the same logic as preview
protected function modifyModelFile(ModelDefinition $modelDefinition, array &$results): void
{
    $modelName = $modelDefinition->model_name;
    $modelPath = app_path("Models/{$modelName}.php");

    if (!File::exists($modelPath)) {
        throw new \Exception("Model file not found: {$modelPath}");
    }

    // Generate the exact same content as the preview
    $newContent = $this->generateModelPreview($modelDefinition);

    File::put($modelPath, $newContent);
    $results['model_file'] = $modelPath;
}

// Migration generation now uses the same logic as preview
protected function modifyMigrationFile(ModelDefinition $modelDefinition, string $tableName, array &$results): void
{
    $migrationFiles = File::glob(database_path('migrations/*_create_' . $tableName . '_table.php'));

    if (empty($migrationFiles)) {
        throw new \Exception("Migration file not found for table: {$tableName}");
    }

    $migrationPath = $migrationFiles[0];

    // Generate the exact same content as the preview
    $newContent = $this->generateMigrationPreview($modelDefinition, $tableName);

    File::put($migrationPath, $newContent);
    $results['migration_file'] = $migrationPath;
}
```

### 2. Fixed Duplicate ID Column Issue
**Problem**: User-defined 'id' columns were being included in addition to Laravel's automatic `$table->id()`.

**Solution**: Modified `generateMigrationPreview` to skip any column named 'id':
```php
foreach ($modelDefinition->columns as $column) {
    // Skip 'id' column since Laravel automatically adds $table->id()
    if (strtolower($column->column_name) === 'id') {
        continue;
    }
    $definition = $this->generateColumnDefinition($column);
    $columnDefinitions[] = "            {$definition}";
}
```

## Results

### Before Fix:
**Migration File:**
```php
Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->bigInteger('id'); // Duplicate!
    $table->string('name');
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
    $table->softDeletes();
})); // Extra parenthesis!
```

**Model File:**
```php
class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;

    /** @use HasFactory<\Database\Factories\PostFactory> */
    use HasFactory;
    // Missing fillable array and casts!
}
```

### After Fix:
**Migration File:**
```php
Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
    $table->softDeletes();
}); // Correct syntax!
```

**Model File:**
```php
class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'description'
    ];

    protected $casts = [
        'name' => 'string',
        'description' => 'string'
    ];
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Generated migration file now matches preview exactly
- ✅ Generated model file now matches preview exactly  
- ✅ No more extra parenthesis in migration
- ✅ No more duplicate id columns
- ✅ Model includes proper fillable array and casts
- ✅ All syntax is correct and follows Laravel conventions

## Files Modified
- `app/Services/ModelGeneratorService.php` - Simplified generation logic and fixed duplicate id issue

The fix ensures that the generated files are now identical to their previews, resolving both reported issues.
